description: JeeBridge exposes your Jeedom devices to Alexa, Apple Home and Google Home via Matter. But its real power lies elsewhere — turning any complex scenario into a single voice command.

Alexa, Siri, Google — these assistants are great for turning on a light or lowering a shutter. But faced with a Jeedom scenario that chains ten actions, queries sensors and applies conditions? They can't do it. JeeBridge solves exactly that.

<!--truncate-->

## What JeeBridge does {#ce-que-fait-jeebridge}

JeeBridge is a Jeedom plugin that installs and manages [MatterBridge](https://github.com/Luligu/matterbridge) — an open-source Matter bridge. Via the **Matter** protocol, your Jeedom devices appear natively in Apple Home, Alexa and Google Home, as if they were directly paired smart objects.

No third-party skill to enable, no intermediate cloud account, no dependency on an external service. Everything runs locally, in a Docker container on your server.

## Exposing devices is good. Triggering scenarios is better {#custom-devices}

Exposing a light or a shutter to Apple Home is useful. But that's just the surface.

JeeBridge's real strength is **Custom mode**: you create a virtual ON/OFF switch in MatterBridge, and attach arbitrary Jeedom actions to it — scenarios, commands, entire sequences. Alexa, Siri or Google Home see a simple button. Behind it, Jeedom does what it does best.

```
"Hey Alexa, activate cinema mode"
              ↓
    Virtual switch ON
              ↓
    Jeedom runs the scenario:
    ├─ Close the living room shutters
    ├─ Set lights to red ambience at 10%
    ├─ Turn on the TV on HDMI 1
    ├─ Enable "Do not disturb" mode
    └─ Cut the music in other rooms
```

From the voice assistant's side, you only said three words.

## Examples of scenarios to delegate {#exemples}

### Cinema mode {#mode-cinema}

A classic scenario combining lights, shutters and multimedia devices. Without JeeBridge, you'd need to open the Jeedom app or use a widget. With JeeBridge:

- ON → shutters closed, dimmed lights, TV on the right input, amplifier at the right volume
- OFF → normal lights, shutters raised, TV off

### Good night {#bonne-nuit}

The evening scenario often stacks a dozen actions: checking openings, turning off lights room by room, setting the thermostat to night mode, activating the perimeter alarm, cutting unnecessary sockets.

One word to Siri from bed: *"Good night"*.

### I'm leaving {#je-pars}

General shutdown, heating economy mode, checking that the garage door is closed, activating presence simulation if needed. From Apple Home or Google Home, this becomes a home screen shortcut or a geolocation-based automation.

### Gradual wake-up {#reveil}

Gradual light ramp-up, coffee machine start, alarm deactivation, bedroom shutters opening based on the wake time set the night before. All triggered by a simple *"Alexa, good morning"* or an Apple Home time-based automation.

## The advantage over native automations {#interet}

Apple Home, Alexa and Google Home offer their own automations. But they're limited to the devices they know, with no access to Jeedom sensors, no advanced conditional logic, none of Jeedom's block power.

With JeeBridge, you keep **all the logic in Jeedom** — conditions, delays, loops, variables, API calls — and only expose a clean ON/OFF button to the assistants. The best of both worlds: the smoothness of voice assistants, the power of Jeedom.

| Native automation | With JeeBridge + Jeedom |
|---|---|
| Limited to Matter/Zigbee devices | Access to all of Jeedom |
| Basic conditional logic | Full scenarios, loops, variables |
| No access to Jeedom sensors | Sensors, history, presence states |
| Dependent on manufacturer's cloud | 100% local |

## Compatibility {#compatibilite}

JeeBridge works with:

- **Apple Home** (iOS 16.2+ / HomePod)
- **Alexa** (Echo with recent firmware)
- **Google Home**

Commissioning is done by scanning a QR code from the plugin's dedicated page — once per controller.

## Requirements {#prerequis}

- Jeedom on **Debian 12** minimum
- **Docker** installed on the system (the [Docker Management](https://market.jeedom.com/index.php?v=d&p=market_display&id=4833) plugin can install it)
- The [JeeBridge](/docs/plugins/jeebridge/) plugin installed from the Market

Voice-controlled home automation shouldn't force you to simplify your scenarios. JeeBridge bridges the gap between Jeedom's power and the simplicity of voice assistants — with no compromise on either side.
